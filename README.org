* Klarkson: an MPD client written in Kotlin.

** Setup

You need to get a Last.fm API key to get album covers. Currently this
feature cannot be disabled, so the key is mandatory to run the client.

#+begin_example
  $ cd src/main/kotlin/
  $ cp SettingsAndConstants.kt.template SettingsAndConstants.kt
  $ edit the new file
#+end_example

** Test coverage and TDD

...is not good. This was started 2 years ago without TDD ideology,
therefore without good tests. I recently started to dig around and do
the whole "add tests to a legacy codebase" routine. Fun stuff.
Kotlin's tools are a pleasure to use.

The tests won't all pass at this time. This is because the code works
as it was previously specified (by me) to work, but I improved the
logic by which the core operations should work and I wrote some
(failing) tests first.
